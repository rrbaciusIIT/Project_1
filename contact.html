<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Business Analyst with a demonstrated history of working with software and hardware in the security
        industry. Additionally, I am obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Management with a specialization
        in technology start-ups and small enterprises from Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Edison Park, Chicago but went to high school in the suburbs to then move back to Chicago. I can't stay away from the city.</p>
    <p>I love working with new technology and developing awesome products for business solutions. Nothing feels better than developing a product to then see people use it daily.</p>
